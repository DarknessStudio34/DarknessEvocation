Android: extract the project file (if you don't have a file manager, I recommend Zarchiver https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) 
-> with Zarchiver: go to the directory where the downloaded file is located (usually in the download folder (/storage/emulated/0/download), click on the file name, then click on 'extract to /filename/' Now copy the following address and paste it into your browser's address bar (note that it should be the address bar (usually at the top of the screen) and not the google search bar): file:///storage/emulated/ 0/download/DarknessEvocation/index.html If there is an error, check if the file is in the downloads folder. Or try replacing the directory above with file:///storage/emulated/0/downloads/DarknessEvocation/index.html or also: file://storage/emulated/0/download/DarknessEvocation/index.html If you still have any questions or it didn't work, please contact DarknessStudio34@gmail.com
